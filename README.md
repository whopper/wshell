wshell (whoppershell)
==========

A C++ learning repository which will eventually build up to a working
(albeit derptastic) shell with custom Unix command implementations.

The general purpose of this repository is to help me pratice up on C++
and learn more about the C++ boost library.

## Existing Commands
* ls
* cat
* touch
